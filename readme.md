# Moon Phase Image Generator ðŸŒ•âœ¨

This project is a Python-based Moon phase image generator that leverages NASA's SPICE toolkit (via SpiceyPy) to accurately compute the Moonâ€™s ephemeris data, including its phase, illumination, and position relative to both the Earth and the Sun. The generated images include a white Moon with a realistic shadow overlay representing the terminator, all composed together to form the final Moon phase image.

---

## Features

- **Accurate Ephemeris Calculations**: Uses SPICE kernels to compute the Moonâ€™s phase angle, illuminated fraction, distance, and more.
- **Realistic Illumination**: Computes a pixel-by-pixel shadow overlay based on the Moonâ€™s local geometry.
- **Image Compositing**: Combines a clean white Moon image with a shadow layer for a visually appealing final result.
- **Enhanced Logging**: Clear, human-friendly logging messages with emojis to guide you through each step of the process.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3**  
- **Required Python Packages**:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `spiceypy`
  - `astropy`
  - `Pillow`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib spiceypy astropy pillow
```

## SPICE Kernels

This project requires a SPICE meta-kernel file named `moon.tm` in the same directory as the script. This meta-kernel should reference the necessary SPICE kernels (e.g., leapseconds, planetary ephemerides) to allow the computations.

---

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Environment**:
    - Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
    - Install the required Python packages.
    - Place the `moon.tm` file in the project directory.

2. **Customize (Optional)**:
    - **Observation Time**: Modify the `time_str` variable in the `main()` function to set your desired UTC observation time.
    - **Observer Location**: Change the observer location (e.g., `new_zealand` or `nl_location`) in the script if needed.
    - **Resolution**: Adjust the `resolution` variable to change the image output resolution.

3. **Run the Script**:

   Make the script executable and run it:

   ```bash
   chmod +x your_script.py
   ./your_script.py
   ```

   Or run it directly with Python:

    ```bash
    python your_script.py
    ```

4. **Output**:  
   The script will create an `output` directory containing:
    - `moon.png`: A white Moon image (a white circle with a black border) on a transparent background.
    - `shadow.png`: A shadow overlay image computed from the Moonâ€™s illumination.
    - `final.png`: The final composite image with the Moon and its terminator (shadow overlay).

## Logging

The script utilizes Python's `logging` module with a custom, emoji-enhanced format to provide clear and fun output messages as it processes the data. This makes it easy to follow along with each stepâ€”from loading the SPICE kernels to generating and compositing the images.

---

## Customization

- **Observation Time**:  
  Change the `time_str` in the `main()` function.  
  Example:
  ```python
  time_str = '2026-05-31T18:30:00'
  ```

- **Observer Location**:  
  Modify the `location` variable in the `main()` function. The example uses New Zealandâ€™s coordinates.  
  Example:
  ```python
  location = new_zealand
  ```

- **Image Resolution & Moon Radius**:  
  Adjust the `resolution` and `R` (Moon radius in arbitrary units) variables as desired for higher quality or differently scaled images.
